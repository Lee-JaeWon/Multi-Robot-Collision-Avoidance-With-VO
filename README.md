# Multi-Robot-Collision-Avoidance-with-VO

## Abstract
This repository for multi-robot collision avoidance using the [Velocity Obstacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_obstacle).<br><br>
Localization is performed through [AMCL(Adaptive Monte Carlo localization)](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) in a saved map made by [Google Cartographer](https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).<br><br>
VO can be used to find the speed closest to the desired speed but not to collide. This is implemented using multiple python scripts and launch files.<br><br>
